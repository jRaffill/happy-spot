Created during Los Altos Hacks 2022

Los Altos Hacks 2022 was my first hackathon, and as the only JavaScript developer on my team, I learned
how to use the Leaflet API to create our team's project. The project is a "crowdsourced" app where
people can share points of interest to help others discover new places in their local area, but nobody
in our team had experience with creating persistent databases so the points of interest are only stored
locally.
